You can set soft and hard limits in on the OpenAI website if you are worried about this."

    "**Note #3:** There is a cost associated with fine-tuning a model through OpenAI. You will be provided with a cost estimate when running the `openai api fine_tunes.create` command. For a Curie or Babbage model the fine-tuning costs are generally managable (i.e., between $5 and $50 for most tasks). \n",
    "\n",
    "---- \n",
